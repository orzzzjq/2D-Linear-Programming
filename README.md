Linear Programming (LP) is a technique for the optimization of a linear objective function, subject to linear inequality constraints. Its feasible region is a convex polytope, which is a set defined as the intersection of finitely many half spaces. Each of a linear programming algorithm finds a point in the polyhedron where this function has the smallest (or largest) value if such a point exists.

Linear programs are problems that can expressed in canonical form as
$minimize \sum_{j=1}^{m} c_j x_j$$
